    <h2> FAQ </h2>
    <img src="images/Raftingfamily.jpg"/>
    <h3> Is this a good trip for kids? </h3>
    <h4> What are the ages ranges you allow? </h4>
    <p>
      Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages.
      We have found however that children over the age of 8 
      seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially 
      enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A 
      common concern we get from parents is that their children will
      be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. 
      Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children 
      of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some 
      of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know 
      what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the 
      rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also 
      comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river
      guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling 
      stories...some of which are even true!

      <h3> Is Whitewater Rafting Safe? </h3>
      <h3> I don't even know how to swim! Can i come? </h3>
      <p>
        As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. 
        To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid 
        and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries 
        are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips 
        wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non 
        swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in 
        depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare
        for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.
