    <p>Hello Everyone, How are you guys doing? Hope everyone are ok.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints for a long time and I went on a mission way 2008. </p>
    <p>I am proudly share that I am happily married to my beautiful wife and we have one kid he is already three years old.
        As of now I am working as online tutor to Japanese people, I am teaching basic English to them. </p>
        <p>To be honest I never reach the college degree that i want for a long time because there are a lot of poor choices back then. It all changes when I got married to my wife and realize how important education is.</p>
        <p>I am very happy when i got my first certificate in BYU as Social media marketing but then I realize How fun coding and want to pursue and master it one day. I know it is not easy task to do but I am willing to learn step by step.</p>
        <p>I am happy to be part on this amazing journey in BYU and I am going to continue improving everyday. Have a nice day everyone. </p>
